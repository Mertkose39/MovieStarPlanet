# Start
Hi! Im releasing a tutorial, how to start sending requests to MSP Servers in C# and PHP

This tutorial allows you to create your own MSP hacks without paying anything!

Credits: ajdot, Pusia, 0x1337 and Deko!

# Tools that you need
So you need this tools: 

  For PHP: `xampp`, `SabreAMF` And a `code editor`!
    
  For CSharp: `Visual Studio` and C# extension `FluorineFX`!
    
And thats it!

# How to send requests?
MovieStarPlanet uses AMF (Action Message Format). We already have done AMF sending with C# and PHP so you dont need to code anything exepct the actions!
But, MSP require a checksum (its an verification to the server that it was send by real MSP client, not edited by charles or something.) fortunately, we have already coded that :)! 

*disclaimer: the checksum isnt full! im lazy to do object hashing xD*

Requests can be collected by this tools: `Fiddler` and `Charles`

*`i don't recommend fiddler because it dosent have AMF decoding built-in`*

If you think that you are ready, go to `php` folder or `csharp` folder!

# Main SWF

If i ever will leave MSP community, im also leaving a tutorial how to decompile Main SWF! 
Just go to `main` folder and theres an explained tutorial!

# Sorry for ruining MSP hacks community
# And no, i will not take this down : )
